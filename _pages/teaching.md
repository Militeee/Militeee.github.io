During my PhD I have teaches some classes of the [Computational Biology](https://dssc.units.it/computational-biology) course at the University of Trieste, targeted for Master's students in [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://dsai.units.it/).

In 2021 I taught a module on **Count-based models for single-cell data**, resources for it and for the whole course can be found [here](https://github.com/caravagn/GDA).

In 2023 I gave a lecture on **Mathematical Models for Subclonal Deconvolution**. The practcal can be found [here](https://github.com/Militeee/computational_biology_practical)
