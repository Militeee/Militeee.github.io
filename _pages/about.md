I am a graduate student in computational biology in the Lab of [Prof. Andrea Sottoriva](https://www.sottorivalab.org/) at [Human Technopole](https://humantechnopole.it/en/), co-supervised by [Prof. Giulio Caravagna](https://www.caravagnalab.org/) at the [University of Trieste](https://portale.units.it/en). I also have a Master's degree in [Data Science and Scientifi Computing](https://dssc.units.it/) from the [University of Trieste](https://portale.units.it/en) and [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/). My main interests are statistical learning and generative models. I have years of experience in developing tools for the analysis of NGS data. Currently, I am focusing on developing deep generative methods to analyze and integrate single-cell multi-omics data, with a particular focus on understanding cancer evolution under therapy. I am also extremely excited about hierarchical models (hierachical VAEs are my obsession rn) and the theory of hierarchy in complex systems ([this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1300832110) gives a good idea of what I am talking about)

In reality, I am basically into every challenging problem that has some maths and stats in it (bonus point if there is biology), so if you are interested in what I do or you want to talk science (and maybe have a cool scientific problem to disucss) feel free to get in touch either by email or on social media.
